    "# Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence II\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to the effective homology version of the spectral sequence of Eilenberg-Moore, in the particular case of classifying spaces. More precisely, let ${\\cal G}$ be a simplicial group; then its classifying space $\\bar{\\cal W}{\\cal G}$ is a simplicial set canonically defined (**J. Peter May**. *Simplicial objects in algebraic topology*, Van Nostrand, 1967.). Furthermore, if ${\\cal G}$ is an Abelian simplicial group, then  $\\bar{\\cal W}{\\cal G}$ is again an Abelian simplicial group with natural structure, so that the $\\bar{\\cal W}$ construction can be iterated. The $\\bar{\\cal W}$ construction is implemented in `Kenzo` only if ${\\cal G}$ is reduced (${\\cal G}_0$ has only one element). In particular if ${\\cal G}$ is a simplicial group with effective homology, then `Kenzo` constructs a version of $\\bar{\\cal W}{\\cal G}$ also with effective homology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The detailed construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let ${\\cal G}$ be a simplicial group with effective homology. This means that a  homotopy equivalence:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  & \\qquad\\hat{C}_* \\cr\n",
    " \\swarrow\\nearrow & & \\searrow\\nwarrow\\qquad \\cr\n",
    "{\\cal C}_*({\\cal G})  & & EG_* \\cr\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$ \n",
    "is provided, where  the chain complex $EG_*$ is effective and must be considered as describing the homology of ${\\cal C}_*({\\cal G})$. This scheme includes the case where ${\\cal C}_*({\\cal G})$ itself is  effective; without any other information, the program  constructs automatically a trivial homotopy equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we apply the *Bar* functor to this homotopy equivalence we obtain the homotopy equivalence $H_R$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  &\\qquad{\\widetilde{Bar}}^{\\hat{ C}_*} \\cr\n",
    " \\swarrow\\nearrow & & \\searrow\\nwarrow\\qquad \\cr\n",

    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "in which the $\\widetilde{Bar}$'s are Bars constructions with respect to the $A_\\infty$ structure on $\\hat{C}_*$ and $EG_*$ defined by the initial homotopy equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analogy  with the result of Julio Rubio (**J.J. Rubio-Garcia**. *Homologie effective des espaces de lacets iteres: un logiciel*, These, Institut Fourier, 1991.) one may show  that it is possible to construct another homotopy equivalence, $H_L$:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",

    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "Both reductions of $H_L$ are obtained by the basic perturbation lemma, as explained in the following section. The composition of both homotopy equivalences, $H_L$ and $H_R$, makes the link between $\\bar{\\cal W}{\\cal G}$, the classifying space of  the simplicial group ${\\cal G}$ and the effective  right bottom  chain complex of $H_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining the left reduction $H_L$\n",
    "\n",
    "The homotopy equivalence  $H_L$ is obtained by a sequence of intermediate constructions based mainly upon two applications of the basic perturbation lemma. We are led to consider the two following modules:\n",
