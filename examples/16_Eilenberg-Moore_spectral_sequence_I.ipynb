    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to the effective homology version of the spectral sequence of Eilenberg-Moore, in the particular case of loop spaces. More precisely, let $X$ be a **1-reduced** simplicial set with effective homology, the program `Kenzo` constructs a 0-reduced simplicial set $GX$ which is also with effective homology. In particular, if $X$ is $m$-reduced, this process may be iterated $m$ times, producing an effective homology version of $G^kX,\\,k\\leq m$. So, the program builds an object which contains a complete solution of the Adams problem about the iteration of the\n",
