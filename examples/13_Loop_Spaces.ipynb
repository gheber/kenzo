    "# Loop Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us recall the definition of the  *free group* generated by a set ${\\cal A}$. Consider the set ${\\cal A}\\times \\lbrace +1, -1 \\rbrace$ and make, as long as there is no ambiguity, the identification $a_i= (a_i,1)$ and $a_i^{-1}= (a_i,-1)$ for all $a_i\\in{\\cal A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition.**  $a_i$ and its formal inverse $a_i^{-1}$ are *letters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition.** A word is a *finite* sequence of letters, possibly repeated, without any pair of the form $a_ja_j^{-1}$ and $a_k^{-1}a_k$. The word is said *reduced*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let $F(\\cal A)$ the set of *words* on $\\cal A$. It is easy to show that if we define in $F(\\cal A)$ an internal law of composition as the formal *concatenation* of two words, on which the cancelation rule is applied, i.e. any pair of the form $a_ja_j^{-1}$ and $a_k^{-1}a_k$ is replaced by the *void sequence*, then $F(\\cal A)$ is a group (non-commutative in general). The void word is the neutral element for that law. If we consider the concatenation as a  *product*, then, as usual in group theory, a sequence of $k$ times the same letter $a$ will be written $a^k$ and a sequence of $k$ times the same letter $a^{-1}$, $a^{-k}$. So a word formed from letters by the  concatenation product together with the cancellation rule, will be written under the reduced form:\n",
    "$$a_1^{n_1}a_2^{n_2}\\ldots a_k^{n_k},\\ n_i\\in \\mathbb{Z}^*,\\ a_i\\in {\\cal A},\\  a_i \\not= a_{i+1}$$\n",
    "and its inverse is\n",
    "$$a_k^{-n_k}\\ldots a_2^{-n_2}a_1^{-n_1}.$$\n",
    "Now let $X$ be a reduced simplicial set (i.e. having only one 0-simplex, namely its base point). The Kan simplicial version $GX$ of the loop space $\\Omega(|X|)$ is defined as follows. The set of $n$-simplices $GX_n$ is the free group generated by the $(n+1)$-simplices $\\sigma \\in X_{n+1}$ except those which are $n$-degenerate. In other words:\n",
    "$$ GX_n=F(X^+_{n+1}),\\ X^+_{n+1}=X_{n+1}-\\eta_n X_n. $$\n",
    "In fact, from a strictly mathematical point of view, the right definition is \n",
    "$$ GX_n = F(X^+_{n+1}) / {\\overline{\\eta_n X_n}},$$\n",
    "i.e. the quotient group of $F(X^+_{n+1})$, the free group generated by **all** the $n+1$-simplices, the $n$-degenerate ones included, by the normal subgroup ${\\overline{\\eta_n X_n}}$ generated by the $n$-degenerate simplices. Both definitions are equivalent, the second is mathematicaly correct but only the first one is visible in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding, we may distinguish carefully a generator $\\sigma$ belonging to  $X_{n+1}$ and the corresponding letter  $\\tau (\\sigma) \\in GX_n$. So a word, element of $GX_n$ will be written \n",
    "$${\\tau(\\sigma_1)}^{\\epsilon_1} {\\tau(\\sigma_2)}^{\\epsilon_2} \\ldots {\\tau(\\sigma_p)}^{\\epsilon_p}.$$\n",
    "Now, let us define two homomorphisms:\n",
    "$$\\overline{\\partial}_i^n: GX_n \\longrightarrow GX_{n-1},\\ \\overline{\\eta}_i^n: GX_n \\longrightarrow GX_{n+1},$$\n",
    "by the following relations, keeping in mind that $\\partial_i$ and $\\eta_i$ are respectively the face and degeneracy operators acting on the  simplices of  $X$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\overline{\\partial}_i(\\tau(\\sigma))  & = & \\tau(\\partial_i\\sigma),\\qquad 0 \\leq i < n, \\\\\n",
    "\\overline{\\partial}_n(\\tau(\\sigma))  & = & \\tau(\\partial_{n+1}\\sigma)^{-1}\\tau(\\partial_n\\sigma), \\\\\n",
    "\\overline{\\eta}_i(\\tau(\\sigma))    & = & \\tau(\\eta_i\\sigma),\\qquad 0 \\leq i \\leq n.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These definitions for the generators of $GX_n$ extend to arbitrary elements in a unique way, for example:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\overline{\\partial}_i(a_1^{n_1} \\cdots a_k^{n_k}) = (\\partial_i(a_1))^{n_1} \\cdots (\\partial_i(a_k))^{n_k}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It is known  that the $\\overline{\\partial}_i$ and the $\\overline{\\eta}_i$ satisfy the fundamental relations between face and degeneracy operators (see the chapter on simplicial sets). So, $GX$ is itself a simplicial set; each $GX_n$ is a group, each face and degeneracy operator is a homomorphism, so that $GX$ is a *simplicial group*. The importance of the simplicial group $GX$ is emphasized by the Kan theorem, stating that if we consider the realization $|X|$ of $X$ and the loop space  $\\Omega(|X|, x_0)$ at the base point $x_0 \\in |X|$,  then $\\Omega(|X|, x_0)$ and the realization $|GX|$ of $GX$ have the same  homotopy type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation of letters and words\n",
    "\n",
    "In the system, the chosen representation for letters and words follows the very definition of the free group $F(X_{n+1}^+)$. Here, a letter is a generator of $GX_n$ i.e. an **abstract simplex** $\\sigma$ of $X^+_{n+1}$. A word will be implemented  as a sequence of such letters to a certain power (including 1). The chosen terminology is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A term like $\\sigma^p$ is a **power**.\n",
    "- A word ${\\sigma_1}^{\\epsilon_1} {\\sigma_2}^{\\epsilon_2} \\ldots {\\sigma_p}^{\\epsilon_p}$ is a **loop**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in this framework the operator $\\tau$ is not visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation of a power\n",
    "\n",
    "A power is internally represented by a lisp object of type  `apowr`. This has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(`*dgop* *gmsm* `.` *expn*`)`\n",
    "\n",
    "in which we may recognize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the components of the abstract simplex: *dgop* and *gmsm*,\n",
    "- the exponent of the letter: *expn*, a non-zero integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The associated  constructor is the macro `apowr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`apowr` *dgop gmsm expn* *[Macro]*\n",
    "> Build an object of type  `apowr`. The accessor macros  are respectively `apdgop`,  `apgmsm` and `apexpn`. There is no special printing function since the real object interesting for the user is not the power but rather the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation of a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A loop is represented by a lisp object of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`#S(LOOP` $apower_1$ ... $apower_k$`)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding type is `LOOP`. The  constructor is the macro `make-loop` but the practical one is `loop3` and the associated\n",
    "printing function prints the object under the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<<Loop [`*ext-dgop1 gmsm1* *expn1*`] ... [`*ext-dgopk gmsmk* *expnk*`]>>`\n",
    "\n",
    "where the *ext-dgop*'s are under the form of a readable sequence of $\\eta$ operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notion of normalized loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing a loop is a matter of factoring the degeneracy operators components (the *dgop*'s) of the *apowr*'s and building an  object of type `ABSM` belonging to the simplicial set $GX$. For instance, the normalized null-loop in dimension 5 is `<AbSm 4-3-2-1-0 <<Loop>>>`. For non-null loops, the following examples show the transformation. We have written the loops under the form printed by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<<Loop [1-0 A\\2]>> ===>  <AbSm 1-0 <<Loop [A\\2]>>>\n",
    "\n",
    "<<Loop [3-2-1 A\\2] [4-2 B\\3]>>  ===>  <AbSm 2 <<Loop [2-1 A\\2] [3 B\\3]>>>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<<Loop [2-1 A\\2] [2-0 B\\2] [1-0 A\\3]>> ===>  \n",
    "\n",
    "       <AbSm - <<Loop [2-1 A\\2] [2-0 B\\2] [1-0 A\\3]>>>\n",
    "\n",
    "<<Loop [2-1-0 A\\2] [2-1-0 B\\2] [2-1-0 A\\3]>> ===>  \n",
    "\n",
    "       <AbSm 2-1-0 <<Loop [A\\2] [B\\2] [A\\3]>>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## A set of functions for loops\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the construction of objects of `LOOP` type, a set of useful functions is provided by the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "`loop3` *dgop1 gmsm1 pwr1 ... dgopk gmsmk pwrk* *[Function]*\n",
    "> Construct a  loop (a word) corresponding to the product of the abstract simplices $asm_i$, the components of which being $dgop_i$ and $gmsm_i$,  to the power $pwr_i$. The function constructs  itself the  objects of type `apowr`  from the arguments.\n",
    "It  accepts an indefinite number of arguments, including none. If there is no argument, the null loop is created. It exists in fact in the system the constant `+null-loop+` which is  the base point of the underlying simplicial group. **Warning**: the function `loop3` does return neither a normalized loop nor a reduced word (no automatic simplification), so it is up to the user to give a correct sequence of arguments corresponding to  a reduced word.\n",

For any other positive integer value $n$ of the second argument, build the $n$-th iterated loop space of $X$. The basic construction is given by the following call to the function `build-smgr`:\n",
    "```\n",
