    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is devoted to the `Kenzo` implementation of the Serre spectral sequence with the aim to compute the homology groups of the total space of a fibration. From the programming point of view, this method will be used according to our general scheme of searching homology (generic function `search-efhm`) applied to an object of type `fibration-total`.\n",

    "## The topological problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let ${\\cal G}$ be a simplicial group (the fiber space),  $B$, a 1-reduced simplicial set (the base space) and $\\tau$ (the fibration), a simplicial morphism of degree $-1$, and $\\tau: B \\rightarrow \\mathcal{G}$ a fibration, that is, a twisting operator as defined in Chapter 12. In the Kenzo program, this object $\\tau$ is implemented as an object of class `simplicial-mrph` and \"degree\" $-1$ while a genuine simplicial morphism has degree 0. We know the program Kenzo knows how to build the total space of the fibration: $B \\times_\\tau {\\cal G}$, which has the same simplices as $B \\times {\\cal G}$ and the same face operators except the last one, given by:\n",

    "where the '`.`' denotes the group operation in ${\\cal G}$. This discrepancy between the respective face operators $\\partial_n$ induces a discrepancy between the differential operators. We suppose now, that the base and  fiber  spaces are objects of effective homology type, i.e. there exist homotopy equivalences\n",

In fact, the chain complex $EB \\widetilde{\\otimes} EG$ is nothing but the Hirsch complex (**Guy Hirsch.** `Sur les groupes d'homologie des espaces fibres`, Bulletin de la Societe Mathematique de Belgique, 1954, vol. 6, pp. 79-96.).\n",

In the first example we define a fibration $\\tau: S^2 \\rightarrow K(\\mathbb{Z},1)$ with $\\tau(s2)= (2)$, then we build the total space of the fibration, namely $P^3\\mathbb{R}$, and we compute some known homology groups."

    "Using the last total space (`total-17`), it is instructive to enter in the details of the resulting homotopy equivalence that the system builds to compute the homology groups. First, the function `echcm` selects the **effective** chain complex of the homotopy equivalence, value of the slot `efhm` of the simplicial set `total-17`, and we may print some basis of this chain complex. In fact, all basis in dimension above 3 are null. The presence of the symbol `S1` is due to the fact that the effective chain complex used for the homology of $K(\\mathbb{Z},1)$ is the circle (see the classifying spaces chapter)."
